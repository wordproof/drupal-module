# Todo

* Should references in the Timestamp entity be true entity_reference fields?
* Node type configuration: form for timestamp type vs node bundle.
* WebHook endpoint: Receiving blockchain information.
* Nested backend Settings: form nested for backend (in config form, use #state and get form from the backend. See jsonapi)
* Render WordProof elements with the element by WordProof
* Possibly implement something like EntityReferenceSelection where you can set the valid entity types for a plugin. This makes installing a specific plugin for other modules easier.
* Timestamp updates: Challenge is to know when a entity is updated, since it can contain referenced entities it should also make sure it updates when references are updated. Possible solution:
  * Loop through all entity-type/entity-bundle where WordProof is activated.
  * Loop through the fields in the view mode (or default) and collect all reference fields.
  * Collect all possible types/bundles it can reference.
  * Save the references (referenced entity -> parent type->bundle and cache that result.
  * Use entity update hook to also check for existence in the array.
* Tests? ;)




* Wordproof -> WordProof

## Done
* Create and use view display `wordproof`: Can be enabled to define what content is rendered and hashed. Fallback to default.
* Data in Stampers: Add the node data to the output of the stampers.
* Render JSON-LD
* Create "timestamp" type for schema_metatag
  * First implementation is a full list of fields. Conclusion is that until the definition is final i implement is as a custom property.
* Timestamp storage: Store metadata for node/revision and hashinput
  * hook_schema() implementation done
  * Update: now using a custom entity as it should.
* Validate Timestamp data to make sure it contains the needed information?


# HashInput?
* For now we do not generate the hashinput locally.

# Done
